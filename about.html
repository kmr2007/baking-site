      <h3>Creaming:</h3>
      <p>
        The process of creaming involves combining butter, sugar, and air using
        a stand mixer, electric beater, or whisk. Once air is incorporated,
        typically eggs or dairy products are then added. This is often followed
        by dry ingredients.
      </p>
      <h3>Folding:</h3>
      <p>
        Folding can be used after creaming (or another method) or by itself. It
        is used to gently incorporate dry ingredients into wet ingredients. It
        is executed with a spatula by gently scraping the bottom of the bowl and
        folding it onto the surface.
      </p>
      <h3>Whipping:</h3>
      <p>
        Whipping is most commonly used with heavy cream or egg whites. This
        process incorporate a lot of air into the liquid. Whipped egg whites and
        sugar makes a meringue while a whipped sweetened heavy cream will make
        whip cream.
